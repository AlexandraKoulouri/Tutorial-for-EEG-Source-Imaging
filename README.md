ERead Tutorial_Dipoles_update to do the tutorial!

In this tutorial we learn how to build the EEG forward and inverse problems
and we will estimate cortical sources based on the MNE solution and sLoreta
It is good as introductory material for students who want to learn more about modelling the EEG source imaging problem
